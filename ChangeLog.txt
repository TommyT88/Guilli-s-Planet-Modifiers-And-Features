Flat world planet picture resets/gets updated/breaks after every survey!

*** TO TEST ***
***************
@Guilliman, I'm running Planet Diversity and Planet Diversity: New World Module. I'm also running the compatibility mod between your mod and Planet Diversity. I did some testing, and found that the precoursor tiles do not spawn on planet types added by planet diversity, but will spawn on vanilla planet types,

hey @Guilliman , shield arrays lost its strength after terraforming, is this normal
issue with starting world changing to other world, some kind of mod incompatibility (not likely my mod issue)
make it so survey options are shown regardless of availible influence. 
Some starting options appear to not be working correctly
fly traps (?) deploying leads to no longer be able to build arachnid armies.
any fix for the precursor energy grid visuals not spawning?

**** TO DO ****
***************

--- gestalt empires now pay no influence to do survey expeditions (drones require no convincing to go look) (TO DO)
--- megacorp empires pay energy instead of influence to do survey expeditions  (TO DO)


--- Precursor Artifacts to "revive" Ego's GF quest.
--- add option to disable AI getting precursor chains
--- machine world modifiers need bonuses (small production ones?)
--- makes the Eath Deatworld more like Earth, I say this because I have started multiple games with Earth as my Deathworld capital and its a tiny bit immersion breaking to have certain modifiers like carnivorous flies and acidic seas (though that last one might become true if climate change keeps going like this). Maybe a little patch that detects if your planet is Earth and gives it appropriate modifiers like Earthquakes, Tsunamies, Volcanos, hyper aggressive bacteria and or predators
--- remove forest modifiers from dry worlds and add new cactus modifiers
--- add option to allow modifiers on homeworld
--- pale blue marble moddifier for earth: carl segan quote as desc.
--- add decision to remove giant arachnids
--- Allow trading of arcane technology with curator stations for empire modifier
--- Maybe allow selling arcane technology for CaravanCoinz
--- Maybe random event/contact by fallen empire to take some arcane technology in return for empire modifier
--- Allow Arcane Technology to be "plugged into" ancient temples planets for something amazing. Maybe add different temples with different effects/rewards. Gotta find them all?
--- Flare star: A flare star is a variable star that can undergo unpredictable dramatic increases in brightness for a few minutes. It is believed that the flares on flare stars are analogous to solar flares in that they are due to the magnetic energy stored in the stars' atmospheres.
