[h1]Precursor Archeotech resource[/h1]
[b]How it works:[/b]
Precursor Archeotech will spawn as a resource on planets with a precursor modifier (either as a space deposit on uninhabitable worlds, or a planetary feature (precursor ruins) on a habitable planet. You can harvest this resource after researching a rare 'Arcane Deciphering' tech. After researching that tech you will gain access to harvesting this resource and the powerful Precursor Archeotech edicts. In the future there may be more exotic things added that require Precursor Archeotech.

[h1]Wondrous Planets[/h1]
[b]How it works:[/b]
At the start of the game, up to one planet of each planet type will be chosen as a wondrous planet. This planet will have unique planetary features on it that provide very large bonuses! Once you have surveyed and discovered a planet like this (or the AI has), the planet name will change to a different colour.

[h1]Discovery! Events [/h1]
[b]How it works:[/b]
When your science ships survey a planet and discover a special modifier on that planet an event will pop up telling you about it. This only happens the first time you discover this modifier. You will have the option to spend some influence to tell your scientist to take another look for extra rewards..

[img]https://i.imgur.com/fvCRIT6.png[/img]
[h1]Colony Events [/h1]
[b]How it works:[/b]
Over 40 mini colony events have been added that can trigger after you have colonised a world with this mod'Äôs modifiers. Several capital event chains to do with your ethic choices have also been added.

[h1]Valuable World Modifier[/h1]
[b]How it works:[/b]
Some dead worlds (barren, frozen, etc) that have specific modifiers will also have a 'valuable world' modifier. This modifier allows terraforming of this world with the right technologies. 

[img]https://i.imgur.com/87GwSej.png[/img]
[h1]Terraforming Interaction[/h1]
[b]How it works:[/b]
When you terraform a planet the following will happen:
[list]
[*] Most bad negative modifiers will be removed (where it makes sense)
[*] Precursor modifiers will NOT be removed
[*] Planet wonders will be removed. 
[*] The newly terraformed planet has a chance to roll new flavour or positive modifiers. Flavour modifiers have a grey border and are just there for story/lore or roleplay.
[*] Turning a planet into a Machine World will remove most modifiers and roll unique machine world modifiers. 
[/list]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/B7VzHEm.png[/img]
[h1]Crisis Interaction[/h1]
[b]How it works:[/b]
Crisis that purge or change planets will have improved interactions with planet modifiers. They will remove and/or roll new modifiers as well. 

[h1]Want to help?[/h1]
I want to expand this mod with more planet modifiers. Feel free to leave suggestions in the comments or the suggestion post! Thank you very much!
