The textures should be .DDS files with DXT5 compression, done with NVIDIA's DDS texture export plugin.

The normal map color channels are shifted to the following after you've finished it as a blue normal map:

R - Red channel

G - Red channel

B - Filled with black (this channel controls emissiveness/light)

A - Green channel

As you can see, it's a matter of moving the green to alpha, copying the red one to the green, and just discarding the blue channel (It's redundant in this case and regenerated by the engine). The normal map should now look yellow and black unless it has any emissive data.

The specular map has material data in it's channels
R - Nation color (Not in active use, left black)

G - Specular (fill material areas with distinct values, leather should be one value, metal another. We usually block these in and avoid making gradients)

B - Metalness (Anything that isn't metal should be black, metal areas are filled in with a higher value, giving it reflectiveness)

A - Gloss (How 'polished' the area is, black (0) means the surface looks rough, white (255) means the area looks polished, and thus also more reflective)

If you're using the Clausewitz texture exporter and it's using the HOI setup, then it ought to be doing the steps above automatically. But one can also move the channels manually and export it as a DDS manually, just remember DXT5 compression or the alpha data is lost.
