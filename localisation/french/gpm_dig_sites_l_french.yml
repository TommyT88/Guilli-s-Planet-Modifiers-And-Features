 gpm_time_lost_digsite:0 "In Search For Time"
 gpm_time_lost_digsite_desc:0 "Time on this planet seems to shift and warp at predictable intervals. Something must be causing this."
 
 gpm_dig_site.10.name:0 "Strange Readings"
 gpm_dig_site.10.desc:0 "Readings taken on the planet indicate all time fluctuations are originating from a point somewhere in the northern hemisphere of this world. It is going to take some time to pinpoint the exact origin of these strange time distortions. While all data indicates the source is at one location, previous in time and somewhere in the near future, the source has moved. And with time flowing backwards and forwards so frequently it isn't easy to determine its current location."
 
 gpm_dig_site.11.name:0 "The Box"
 gpm_dig_site.11.desc:0 "We've found the current location of whatever is causing these time distortions. If there is such a thing as current on this world anyway. The fluctuations seem to be coming from a half buried strange blue rectangle box that has been left on this planet. We're currently trying to get inside of it."
 
 gpm_dig_site.12.name:0 "The Doc"
 gpm_dig_site.12.desc:0 "After multiple attempts we've finally been able to get inside this strange blue box. It appears to be slightly bigger on the inside than the outside. Inside in the middle of the box, or room at this point, we've found a strange spherical device. This device seems to have some relativistic time influence over other objects near it. The box however seemed to have amplified the effect substantially, albeit uncontrollably.\nSome notes were also found spread across the walls of this box. Most are just dribble about time being a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff. None mention a name or an owner of this box and the sphere. Except for one note; which was signed with 'The Doc'."

 gpm_precursor_generic_digsite:0 "Precursor Expedition"
 gpm_precursor_generic_digsite_desc:0 "This world used to belong to an ancient precursor civilisation. We must prepare an expeditionary team to survey this world from the ground.\n\nFirst thing to do is find a suitable location and set up a forward expeditionary camp. Duo to the many dangers of this world, and possible autonomous defensive systems, this will not be an easy task."

 gpm_dig_site.100.name:0 "Base of operations"
 gpm_dig_site.100.desc:0 "The expedition team found a safe spot to set up camp. Additional equipment and personnel are being dropped off to the makeshift camp with small drop-ships. An expedition is now getting ready to search the nearby precursor ruins. "
 gpm_dig_site.100.a:0 "Excellent"

 gpm_dig_site.110.name:0 "Searching the unknown"
 gpm_dig_site.110.desc:0 "The expeditionary team has been sent out along a narrow path alongside the first outer ruins. This to, hopefully, avoid any surprises that may lie on the main path. It will take some time before they reach an alternative way into the ruins."
 gpm_dig_site.110.a:0 "Understood"

 gpm_dig_site.120.name:0 "Old is an understatement"
 gpm_dig_site.120.desc:0 "The team has made it into the ruins and have found it to be quite safe.\n\nSeveral small artifacts have so far been discovered along the route the expeditionary team has taken. Trinkets, tools, but also small electronic devices. A cursory analysis reveals them to be over 100.000 years old!\n\nThe supplies of the team are running low, so they are returning to base camp. Meanwhile a secondary expedition team is heading out."
 gpm_dig_site.120.a:0 "Excellent find!"

 gpm_dig_site.130.name:0 "New Route"
 gpm_dig_site.130.desc:0 "Our secondary expedition team has found a few tunnel systems and has discovered they lead into a well-preserved six-sided chamber, possibly leading into a a bigger complex. The chamber has five other doors but they appear to be locked.\n\nTools and equipment are being brought in to assist in breaching the locked doors."
 gpm_dig_site.130.a:0 "Continue with caution!"

 gpm_dig_site.140.name:0 "We're in!"
 gpm_dig_site.140.desc:0 "We have finally breached one of the locked doors! It looks like this is a rather large complex, part of the ruins above perhaps. Our expedition team is splitting up into groups of two in order to more efficiently explore the chambers of this complex.\nWho knows what they'll find. Or what will find them.."
 gpm_dig_site.140.a:0 "Record everything!"

 # default
 gpm_dig_site.150.name:0 "Unnamed Ruins"
 gpm_dig_site.150.desc:0 "After an extensive search across the ruins the secondary expedition has recovered only a handful of artifacts. Some small devices, heirlooms and cultural artifacts as well as a single working data slate.\n\nMost of the data has been lost however, or has been corrupted, but fortunately we've managed to recover some technological data."
 gpm_dig_site.150.a:0 "A good find none the less."
 gpm_dig_site.150.MEGACORP:0 "Sell it on the black market"

 # power array
 gpm_dig_site.151.name:0 "Power Facility"
 gpm_dig_site.151.desc:0 "These appear to be the ruins of an old power facility. Throughout several of the chambers of this complex, energy relays and power arrays were discovered. Most of them in such a bad state there is little to be learned from them however. We did find an interesting terminal in one of the deeper chambers and have pulled some incredible information from it."
 gpm_dig_site.151.a:0 "Excellent discovery!"
 gpm_dig_site.151.MEGACORP:0 "Information is profit"
 
 #  ship disign facilicy
 gpm_dig_site.152.name:0 "Ship Design Institute"
 gpm_dig_site.152.desc:0 "Within these ruins we've stumbled upon a series of connecting rooms filled with large holo-boards and 3D-Fabricators. Some of the boards still function, barely. Some attempts have been made to decipher the intricate and complex writing and equations on the boards. It appears to be early designs for a new ship, a large one at that. A lengthy colossal ship with 4 hanger bays and, what we think are, repair bays. This colossal ship, this 'juggernaut', was in the early stages of design before this facility was abandoned."
 gpm_dig_site.152.a:0 "Juggernaut sounds amazing"
 gpm_dig_site.152.MEGACORP:0 "War is good business"
 
 # orbital monitoring station
 gpm_dig_site.153.name:0 "Orbital Monitoring Station"
 gpm_dig_site.153.desc:0 "Every chamber of this buried facility is covered with monitors, holo-screens and virtualisation globes. They appear to have been used to monitor everything going into and out of orbit from this world. Billions of miniature satellites must have been used originally to watch everything on and around this world. Not much is left from those however.. The data storage units on some of these virtualisation globes should still be recoverable."
 gpm_dig_site.153.a:0 "So much surveillance.."
 gpm_dig_site.153.MEGACORP:0 "These will sell easy on the market"
 
 # bunker
 gpm_dig_site.154.name:0 "Old Bunker"
 gpm_dig_site.154.desc:0 "The walls and ceilings of these chambers are extremely reinforced with neutronium and some kind of moving, or "living" metal. They seem to repair most of the damage our tools did to the doors after we opened them. There are signs of firefights and explosions inside of the chambers, but the walls, floors, doors and ceilings all appear to be in pristine condition. This complex must have been some kind of bunker or at least a very heavy fortified facility."
 gpm_dig_site.154.a:0 "Interesting!"
 gpm_dig_site.154.MEGACORP:0 "Sell everything not stuck to the floor"
 
 # command center
 gpm_dig_site.155.name:0 "Command Center"
 gpm_dig_site.155.desc:0 "Deep within the series of chambers we stumbled upon a central large chamber. The walls lined up with monitors, communication devices, and also preserved carcases of dead aliens. In the centre of the room sits an empty throne surrounded by miniature monitors and various tubes, communication interfaces and small platforms full of intractable interfaces. This must have been some kind of command centre from where this precursor waged their wars."
 gpm_dig_site.155.a:0 "Recover the throne as well!"
 gpm_dig_site.155.MEGACORP:0 "This throne is solid gold!"
 
 # crashed floating city
 gpm_dig_site.156.name:0 "Crashed City"
 gpm_dig_site.156.desc:0 "It didn't take long to realise the series of rooms and corridors we entered are part of a single large complex. When we tried to go further, we stumbled upon buried streets, transportation devices and entire buildings. This is an entire city! A crashed one like the ones found on this world. The devastation must have been tremendous, and the loss of life unimaginable. We're trying to salvage as much as we can before the rest of this place collapses on itself."
 gpm_dig_site.156.a:0 "A horrific discovery"
 gpm_dig_site.156.MEGACORP:0 "Sell the personal belongings too!"
 
 # administrative hub
 gpm_dig_site.157.name:0 "H.U.B."
 gpm_dig_site.157.desc:0 "Most of the adjacent chambers are empty. Long ago abandoned by their original creators. All except one. It appears a central large computer is still there. The broken down machine bears the designation 'H.U.B.' and has been offline for thousands of years. It is believe this was the central unit, a 'mind' capable of running the entire complex autonomously. Not much data was recoverable, but we definitely did not leave empty handed."
 gpm_dig_site.157.a:0 "Excellent"
 gpm_dig_site.157.MEGACORP:0 "AI always fetches a nice price"
 
 # communication tower
 gpm_dig_site.158.name:0 "Communications Facility"
 gpm_dig_site.158.desc:0 "Dozens of single sectioned off units are spread across each chamber. Walls only half as high as the room. Each section has a small entrance and appears to be filled with a type of working station, monitors of some kind and various communication devices. Strangely enough in some of these workstations we found ancient intoxicating beverages, trace amounts of hallucinogenic substances or small pocket sized firearms. This appears to not have been a nice place to work, or perhaps the happiest place."
 gpm_dig_site.158.a:0 "How peculiar"
 gpm_dig_site.158.MEGACORP:0 "Drugs are good money"
 
 # quantum databanks
 gpm_dig_site.159.name:0 "Quantum Databanks"
 gpm_dig_site.159.desc:0 "Endless rows of brightly lit databanks stretch out into these vast chambers. They each seem to have their own endless power units and are mostly still intact and running. Despite the layers of dust and rock on top of them. We're pulling as much data as we can from them."
 gpm_dig_site.159.a:0 "A great opportunity to learn"
 gpm_dig_site.159.MEGACORP:0 "Alien research? Sell Sell Sell"
 
 # abandoned fortress
 gpm_dig_site.160.name:0 "Impenetrable Fortress"
 gpm_dig_site.160.desc:0 "It didn't take long for our two man teams to keep running into each other in this ruined complex. It is a maze, a labyrinth, something far worse.. All paths cross, and all paths are dead ends. It seems like this complex uses miniature wormholes hidden behind reflector fields to trick and move intruders across the various entrances and dead ends of this complex. It'll take a while to map out all the routes, dead ends and wormholes, and get into the innards of this complex."
 gpm_dig_site.160.a:0 "I'm already confused"
 gpm_dig_site.160.MEGACORP:0 "Tear down the fields emitters"
 
 # escapee hideout
 gpm_dig_site.161.name:0 "Escapee's Hideout"
 gpm_dig_site.161.desc:0 "It's unknown what part of the prison complex this old place used to be. But it seemed to have been repurposed as a shelter or hideout for escaped prisoners. Dozens of discarded prison outfits, chains and destroyed tracking devices were found inside. Several propaganda manuals are also found across the hideout or shelter. All of them either burned or damaged. We're trying to salvage what we can from the devices and learn as much from the manuals."
 gpm_dig_site.161.a:0 "What a miserable place"
 gpm_dig_site.161.MEGACORP:0 "Salvage everything!"
 
 # mining unit storage
 gpm_dig_site.162.name:0 "Mining Unit Storage"
 gpm_dig_site.162.desc:0 "Rows and rows of inactive derelict droids stand before us. Each chamber housing similar droids with different tools and configurations. After many hours of trying we have finally successfully connected to the positronic brain of one of the droids and have downloaded a large amount of data."
 gpm_dig_site.162.a:0 "Fascinating!"
 gpm_dig_site.162.MEGACORP:0 "We already have a buyer"
 
 # weapons manufactory
 gpm_dig_site.163.name:0 "Weapons Manufactory"
 gpm_dig_site.163.desc:0 "Each chamber is filled with overlapping conveyor belts, pneumonic pressure plates and various robotic arms. Various types of weapon components and their finished or unfinished parts can be found throughout the facility. The various chambers seem to be a series of manufacturing steps for whatever weapon this facility produced so many millennia ago."
 gpm_dig_site.163.a:0 "Interesting!"
 gpm_dig_site.163.MEGACORP:0 "Put every weapon you find in crates!"
 
 # vaults
 gpm_dig_site.164.name:0 "Ancient Vaults"
 gpm_dig_site.164.desc:0 "Once we reached the inner chambers we discovered this was not just any complex. It was the vault itself. Many vaults to be precise. We're still analysing everything we found here, but the knowledge and resources left behind here will keep our scientist busy for generations."
 gpm_dig_site.164.a:0 "Amazing!"
 gpm_dig_site.164.MEGACORP:0 "Barrel up the resources!"
 
 # burried crashed orbital
 gpm_dig_site.165.name:0 "Crashed Orbital"
 gpm_dig_site.165.desc:0 "The layout of these chambers indicate this used to be part of a large, flat complex with a surface. The chambers, in sets of three, all appear to be slightly higher in level the further you go in. This might mean this used to be part of a more circular super structure. It's theorised this could have been part of an orbital. A large, artificial world in the shape of a ring."
 gpm_dig_site.165.a:0 "Interesting theory"
 gpm_dig_site.165.MEGACORP:0 "Cut up any valuable materials"
 
 # outpost ruins
 gpm_dig_site.166.name:0 "Abandoned Outpost"
 gpm_dig_site.166.desc:0 "It looks like this was nothing more than an outpost. Few tools, containers and barely noteworthy amenities are spread out in this place. Some old devices and weapons have been found as well. It appears to have been abandoned in a hurry."
 gpm_dig_site.166.a:0 "Salvage what you can"
 gpm_dig_site.166.MEGACORP:0 "Sell it all!"
 
 # harbor warehouse
 gpm_dig_site.167.name:0 "Collapsed Warehouse"
 gpm_dig_site.167.desc:0 "Several large chambers were found to be full of containers. Many made from an unknown material. We were reluctant to open these, but the few we found already opened contained nothing more than generic tools and materials. After opening some of the ones in the back we've found some interesting devices and materials."
 gpm_dig_site.167.a:0 "Excellent discovery"
 gpm_dig_site.167.MEGACORP:0 "Sell it all on the 'market'"
