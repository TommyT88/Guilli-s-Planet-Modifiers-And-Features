 # gpm_Habitat_Outpost_Specialisation_desc:0 "This habitat has been outfitted with long range scanners, communication systems and monitoring systems. Greatly increases this habitat's sensor range and defensive capabiltiies."
 
 # gpm_Habitat_Food_Specialisation:0 "Food Specialisation"
 # gpm_Habitat_Food_Specialisation_desc:0 "This habitat has been outfitted with large bio-domes allowing for a much greater variety and greater quantity of food to be produced." 
 
 # gpm_Habitat_Minerals_Specialisation:0 "Mineral Specialisation"
 # gpm_Habitat_Minerals_Specialisation_desc:0 "This habitat has been outfitted with industrial matter-replicators. By converting energy we are able to produce all the minerals we need." 
 
 # gpm_Habitat_Army_Specialisation:0 "Army Specialisation"
 # gpm_Habitat_Army_Specialisation_desc:0 "This habitat has been outfitted with various battle simulators and combat areas. It also houses a dedicated military academy allowing us to produce more armies." 
 
 # gpm_Habitat_Science_Specialisation:0 "Science Specialisation"
 # gpm_Habitat_Science_Specialisation_desc:0 "This habitat has been outfitted with advanced laboratories and a central science academy. This will allow us to consolidate research fields and help us understand the universe to a much greater degree."
