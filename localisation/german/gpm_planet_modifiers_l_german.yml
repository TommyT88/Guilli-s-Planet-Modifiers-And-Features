 gpm_temple_of_the_ancient_one_desc:0 "The breath taking, indescribable beauty of the ruined, mysterious rock-hewn temple, would be amazing to any that were to spend time looking at it if it was not for its dangerous allure. Stories are scribbled on the walls, warning almost, of previous explorers who spend days in darkness as they wandered around the temple. In the end, they were no longer able to resist the powerful visions and auditory hallucinations that appeared, nor the madness-inspired impulse to enter the inner sanctum of the temple. The inner sanctum, now appearing to you impossibly illuminated by what seems to be a flickering altar flame.."

 gpm_proto_forests:0 "Proto Forests"
 gpm_proto_forests_desc:0 "With a diameter of up to 1 m, and a height reaching 8 m, these proto forest trees are fairly small. Viewed from afar, the trees take the form of tree-trunks, spreading slightly near their base in a fashion that suggests a connection to unpreserved root-like structures. Concentric growth rings, sometimes containing embedded plant material, suggest that the organism grows sporadically by the addition of external layers. It is probable that the "trunks" represent the fruiting body, or "sporophore", of a fungus, which would be fuelled by a mycelium, a net of dispersed hyphae filaments."

 gpm_dense_forests:0 "Dense Forests"

 gpm_hiveworld:0 "Hiveworld Fossils"
 gpm_hiveworld_desc:0 "These fossilized remnants of worlds seem to have thousands of synapse nodes spread on them. Serving as massive bio-factories that could churn out the endless swarms of bio-forms. Hive worlds as we name them seem to have been living creatures on their own, incorporating millions of bioengineered organisms. Each was a biological factory capable of creating trillions of large and small organisms, of replicating genomes and splicing together new creatures perfectly adapted for each new world and environment they are found on. We can only hope these types of creatures are no longer amongst us.."

 gpm_periodic_meteor_showers:0 "Periodic Meteor Showers"
 gpm_periodic_meteor_showers_desc:0 "A reoccurring celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering the gravitational pull of the world at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, on atmospheric rich worlds they almost never reach the surface duo to burning up. Intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms. These displays can sometimes be very beautiful to observe."

 gpm_arachnophobia:0 "Arachnophobia"
 gpm_arachnophobia_desc:0 "A world overrun by packs of giant arachnids. It seems like madness to even think of setting foot on this world. Early explorers tell stories of night-time hissing coming from the treetops and caverns, of endless thumping sounds as they hear these arachnids walk over their ship. It is not known if any of the early explorers actually set foot outside of their ship or if they just sent a drone and lied in their reports."

 gpm_giant_worm:0 "Giant Worm"
 gpm_giant_worm_desc:0 "Colossal worms that live beneath the sand. They are easily attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, and they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations almost immediately. This seems to be an effort to defend their territory, of which they seem to be highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, might be a rarity in itself. The sandworms are extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sense each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats. Despite all the potential danger, the spice must flow."

 gpm_artificial_core:0 "Artificial Core"
 gpm_artificial_core_desc:0 "This world should have died long ago after the core froze and the magnetic field died, but a massive installation in the planet's core, made by a particularly powerful precursor empire somehow keeps the core spinning and the magnetic field active."

 gpm_omnious_fog_desc:0 "Every time it gets dark, a strange dark purple fog starts seeping out of the ground. Our scans show this to be just water vapour, yet there is something strange about it. The fog moves around as if it has a will of its own.."

 gpm_beautiful_planet_rings:0 "Beautiful Planetary Rings"

 gpm_sandstorms:0 "Sandstorms"
 gpm_sandstorms_desc:0 "On a windy day, giant, short lived walls of sand occasionally cover the surface with a thin layer of sand. Although these sandstorms happen quite frequently, they are more of an annoyance than a danger. A quick sweeping with a brush is enough to clean up any sand. With a bit of luck the next winds will just blow it all away again."

 gpm_sand_tornadoes:0 "Sand Tornadoes"
 gpm_sand_tornadoes_desc:0 "Occasionally sand tornadoes can be seen on this world. Though very small they usually happen in clusters of about three to seven depending on the terrain and direction of wind. The sand is fairly reflective which causes the sand tornadoes to almost shine in the sunlight. Very beautiful, albeit a bit chaotic, to see."

 gpm_quicksand:0 "Quicksand Plains"
 gpm_quicksand_desc:0 "Large pools of loose soil on this world is seen to behave much like quicksand. Though unlike quicksand it doesn't always have to be wet, which makes it very deceptive and dangerous.

The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying colour and complexity."

 gpm_spirals_of_ice:0 "Spirals of Ice"
 gpm_spirals_of_ice_desc:0 "Very unusual features are found on this planet. The cold wind and moist air tend to form spirals of ice. Some of these spirals have grown so large they match our tallest buildings. It's remarkable how not a single crack can be found on them as well as no air bubbles which makes them crystal clear. During the night they reflect the galaxy's light in a beautiful display of colours."
 
 gpm_furry_packs:0 "Furry Packs"
 gpm_furry_packs_desc:0 "This world is inhabited by huge roaming packs of giant, four legged creatures. These creatures have massive horns on their head and a long, and very nimble, extra arm as nose. They are covered in a thick, mostly brown fur to keep them warm during the nights. They seem to be a very social type of animal. It's not known how, but they seem to take the same route around the world looking for food every season. Perhaps they're just good at remembering the terrain they roam."

 gpm_blizzards:0 "Blizzards"
 gpm_blizzards_desc:0 "It always starts with light snowfall, but this world's weather always follows the same pattern. Light snow, heavy wind and in just a moment's notice, it becomes a full-fledged blizzard. With snowfall so dense you can hardly see the end of your extremities."

 gpm_abominable_predators:0 "Abominable Predators"
 gpm_abominable_predators_desc:0 "On cold nights, this creature roams the lands looking for food. It's massive height and large forearms are a terrifying sight. While they don't hunt in packs they are seen to be living in small groups of around four to six. These creatures have a thick light-blue to white coat of fur and giant claws. It behaves almost apelike and has been observed to communicate through grunts and gestures with its fellow companions."

 gpm_otherworldly_colours:0 "Otherworldly Colours"
 gpm_otherworldly_colours_desc:0 "This world's vegetation comes in all sorts of colours. The most remarkable thing is, the vegetation colour depends on the latitude of the planet. From bright yellow flowers and trees on the equator to deep purple grass near the arctic. This world feels truly alien."

 gpm_misty:0 "Misty"
 gpm_misty_desc:0 "This world's surface is almost completely covered in mist. The combination of pressure and temperature cause the oceans and lakes to give off a lot of water vapour that hangs around the surface."

 gpm_ecological_nervous_system:0 "Ecological Nervous System"
 gpm_ecological_nervous_system_desc:0 "The plant life on this world seems to be connected to each other through a complex root system. The energetic pulses that run through it is very reminiscent of a nervous system. Observations have found that killing one plant has an effect on nearby plants as they seem to close their flowers or slowly grow in the opposite direction."

 gpm_carnivorous_flies:0 "Carnivorous Flies"
 gpm_carnivorous_flies_desc:0 "These tiny flies may seem like just an annoyance, they are the most dangerous creatures on this world. These tiny flies glow in the dark at night, but that's not when they're out feeding. During the night they glow as a means to attract other carnivorous flies as a part of their mating ritual, which seems to be quite complex. During the day they fly around looking for food.\nBeing carnivorous, they tend to swarm their prey and eat it alive in a matter of hours. Large, or small, all creatures are food for them. What makes it even worse is their colony like behaviour, allowing them to navigate complex tunnels.. or vents! The fact that they emit no noise to even warn their next meal is the worst part."

 gpm_algae_boom:0 "Algae Boom"
 gpm_algae_boom_desc:0 "This world is in the midst of a century long algae boom. Millions of tons of algae cover the planet's oceans and lakes. While it looks bad, it's actually very good for the wildlife and air quality."

 gpm_ocean_currents_desc:0 "The ocean currents of this world are remarkably complex and highly unusual. While warm water has a chance to reach even the furthest areas of this world allowing for more favourable conditions for life, cold areas of the ocean have a dangerous pull. Anyone caught into these currents will be sucked down and quickly crushed by the extreme pressures."

 gpm_giant_ocean_snakes:0 "Gigantic Ocean Dragons"
 gpm_giant_ocean_snakes_desc:0 "Giant underwater dragons roam the ocean's seafloor. These scaly reptiles can become hundreds of feet long and are seen to be extremely predatory.

They are the apex predator of this world's oceanic life."

 gpm_ocean_trenches:0 "Extreme Ocean Trenches"
 gpm_ocean_trenches_desc:0 "The unfathomable deep trenches of the ocean floor on this world will probably never be fully explored. The depth pressure is enough to buckle any exploration vessel and outright destroy even the material it's made from.

They don't even realize their crewmates are gone until asked about the absent people. Investigations always reveal our landing site covered in viscera and the torn limbs of the missing explorers. Something strange is happening on this world. The superstitious whisper that it is cursed. Our scientists dismiss those rumors, but they have yet to find an explanation for these tragedies."
 
 gpm_sunken_cities:0 "Sunken Cities"
 gpm_sunken_cities_desc:0 "Millennia ago, this planet was a continental world home to a sentient species. However, their industrialisation efforts started a process that melted the planet's large glaciers and ultimately terraformed the planet.
