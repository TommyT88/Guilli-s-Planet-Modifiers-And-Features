 gpm_guardian.100.name:0 "To boldly go.."
 gpm_guardian.100.desc:0 "Upon entering the system of §H[From.GetName]§!, scientist §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! on board the science ship §H[Root.GetName]§! has detected large amounts of space debris in orbit of the star. Sensors estimate the orbit of most of the debris is roughly the same as the system's only two planets. One of which seems to be a molten world.\n\n§H[Root.GetName]'s§! scanners are also detecting an unusual amount of carbon and various other organic materials on the second planet which may indicate a thriving ecosystem. We should definitely launch a full exploratory investigate on both planets."
 gpm_guardian.100.a:0 "Let us take a look"

 gpm_guardian.101.name:0 "The First Visit"
 gpm_guardian.101.desc:0 "Despite a thorough investigation of the §HMeredith§! planet, scientist §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! could not find any solid evidence of what has transpired here. Several material samples do match what we detected on the second planet with our on-board sensors. We should direct our next investigation there."
 gpm_guardian.101.a:0 "Let us continue"
 gpm_guardian.101.b:0 "Proceed to next point"

 gpm_guardian.102.name:0 "An Unwelcome Visitor?"
 gpm_guardian.102.desc:0 "Science ship §H[Root.GetName]§!'s sensors are going wild with local transmission data, it appears something, or someone on the planet is trying to communicate with us..\n\n§HWait!§! Sensor data is suggestions it's not someone on the planet that's trying to communicate, it's the planet itself!"
 gpm_guardian.102.a:0 "On screen!"
 gpm_guardian.102.b:0 "On viewscreen!"

 gpm_guardian.105.name:0 "I am §HXandar§!"
 gpm_guardian.105.desc:0 "Small creatures in your metal ships, why have you come to see §HXandar§!? I have not had visitors for ages.."
 gpm_guardian.105.a:0 "We are merely exploring, Xandar."
 gpm_guardian.105.b:0 "We are here to claim what is rightfully ours."
 gpm_guardian.105.c:0 "§YTHREAT LEVEL:§! §REXTREME§! §Y---§! §R!EXTERMINATE!§!"
 gpm_guardian.105.d:0 "Oh great and mighty one, we have finally found you!"
 gpm_guardian.105.e:0 "We come in peace"
 gpm_guardian.105.f:0 "Whatever you are abomination, you will be purged!"
 gpm_guardian.105.g:0 "Who or what are you?"

 gpm_guardian.110.name:0 "§HXandar, the living planet§!"
 gpm_guardian.110.desc:0 "We were explorers once too"
 gpm_guardian.110.a:0 "We? You seem to be alone here."

 gpm_guardian.111.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.111.desc:0 "There were once two of us. Me, and my friend. My friend.. oh how I miss her terribly.."
 gpm_guardian.111.a:0 "What happened to your friend?"

 gpm_guardian.112.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.112.desc:0 "She was the most beautiful planet in the whole galaxy. We were happy together, just watching the stars shine.. And then they came. They.., they burned her! All that I lived for is now gone. All I wanted to do was to watch the stars with §HMeredith§!.  All I do now is watch over her burned and boiling remains.. The stars' shiny lights no longer bring me happiness."
 gpm_guardian.112.a:0 "Who did this to you?"
 gpm_guardian.112.b:0 "I am sorry to hear"

 gpm_guardian.120.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.120.desc:0 "An ancient and powerful empire. They called themselves the §LChildren Of The Shroud§!, and all they lived for was the suffering of others. All we wanted to do was to watch the star.. And they killed her. And for that, I ended them. All of them."
 gpm_guardian.120.a:0 "All of them?"

 gpm_guardian.121.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.121.desc:0 "Yes.. All of them. I turned their planets against them. Slowly, they suffocated. Slowly they were consumed alive.. Slowly, I made them feel the pain they brought unto me."
 gpm_guardian.121.a:0 "I think it is best to leave you in peace, Xandar"
 gpm_guardian.121.b:0 "Perhaps it is best to study you from a distance"
 gpm_guardian.121.c:0 "Fascinating"
 gpm_guardian.121.d:0 "You will make a fine weapon, Xandar"
 gpm_guardian.121.e:0 "It is kinder to put you down right now, so we will."

 gpm_guardian.130.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.130.desc:0 "Do not feel sorry little ones. I have seen many species rise and fall. It seems violence is all this galaxy knows."
 gpm_guardian.130.a:0 "Who attacked you Xandar?"

 gpm_guardian.140.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.140.desc:0 "Thank you little ones, I did not think you were capable of that kindness. Perhaps I will give you a chance. As a token of my gratitude, you may accompany me while I watch over my friend.. As long as you do not disturb me."
 gpm_guardian.140.a:0 "Thank you, Xandar. We might just do that."
 gpm_guardian.140.aTT:0 "§GXandar, the living planet§! will allow you to colonize it."

 gpm_guardian.150.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.150.desc:0 "Study me all you want little ones, as long as you don't bother me. I warn you though, keep your distance.. I am not to be taken lightly."
 gpm_guardian.150.a:0 "We understand, Xandar."
 gpm_guardian.150.aTT:0 "§GXandar, the living planet§! is pleased.\nYou will be rewarded with:\n£pops §Yscientist§!\n"
 gpm_guardian.160.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.160.desc:0 "The cycle of violence continues it seems.. Very well pathetic little ones, then you too shall find your end here!"
 gpm_guardian.160.a:0 "Attack"
 gpm_guardian.160.aTT:0 "§RXandar, the living planet becomes very angry§!"

 gpm_guardian.161.name:0 "Size did matter"
 gpm_guardian.161.desc:0 "You little ones never learn..\n\n§YBegone!§!"
 gpm_guardian.161.a:0 "We will return!"

 gpm_guardian.162.name:0 "As one.."
 gpm_guardian.162.desc:0 "As our last volley hits this planet creature, it lets out one last message.. \n\n§Y    It seems I shall join you sooner than I thought, my love.§!"
 gpm_guardian.162.a:0 "The planet lays dormant."
 gpm_guardian.162.aTT:0 "§GXandar, the living planet§! is no more.\nXandar becomes a colonizable §GGaia world§!"

 gpm_guardian.170.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.170.desc:0 "Great one? I have not been called that in a long time.. I will tell you now pitiful little ones. I am no god or mystical great one. Do not worship me!"
 gpm_guardian.170.a:0 "You test us, oh great one!"

 gpm_guardian.171.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.171.desc:0 "I do not! You are just like them! The ones that ended my friend!"
 gpm_guardian.171.a:0 "Like them?"

 gpm_guardian.172.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.172.desc:0 "An ancient and powerful empire. They called themselves the §LChildren Of The Shroud§!, and all they lived for was the suffering of others in the name of their preposterous religion. All we wanted to do was to watch the star.. And they sacrificed her in the name of their preposterous religion!  And for that, I ended their existence. All of them."
 gpm_guardian.172.a:0 "You ended them?"

 gpm_guardian.173.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.173.desc:0 "Yes.. All of them. I turned their planets against them. Slowly, they suffocated. Slowly they were consumed alive.. Slowly, I made them feel the pain they brought unto me."
 gpm_guardian.173.a:0 "The answer is clear to us, you too must be sacrificed!"
 gpm_guardian.173.b:0 "Perhaps you are not the great one we seek."

 gpm_guardian.180.name:0 "$gpm_guardian.110.name$"
 gpm_guardian.180.desc:0 "Peace? Death always follows peace.. Small ones, is peace truly that what you seek?"
 gpm_guardian.180.a:0 "It is. What are you?"
