 gpm_colony.3.name:0 "Not exactly scrap metal"
 gpm_colony.3.desc:0 "Our initial scans of this world showed a lot of metal from the crashed ships. There must be hundreds spread out over this world. Unfortunately, due to the many alloys and busted electronics of these colossal crashed ships our scans were subjected to heavy electromagnetic interference and thus were unable to give a detailed reading of every wreck.\nNow that we have started doing visual inspections we have discovered something amazing. A few of the ships down there are still emitting EM-radiation, meaning there is still power left in them. Perhaps their databanks can teach us something about their designs, or their makers."

Sadly not much was able to be gained from their databases; it seems to have been standard procedure to wipe them if the ship became unusable.\nDuring our salvaging we did stumbled upon another ship wreck. This one is far far more complete. Our engineers have proposed to try and repair it with parts from a nearby wreck. Perhaps even use it as a template to try and salvage a few more nearby ships that don't look too terrible damaged."

The shiny hull that was showing isn't just a small crashed ship; it was just a single section of a much larger ship. A ship that was surprisingly still in one piece. After digging it out we discovered the reason it failed was a direct hit to its control center which threw it spiralling down into the planet.\nAfter gathering parts from nearby ships we were able to construct a control center in the ship entirely to our own specifications. After powering up the ship we were surprised how easily it's integrated AI was able to translate and support our own systems. It only took a few days for our instruments to control the ship.

The crystalline plants that make up the giant forest appear in even greater numbers around the entrance, enveloping the mound that rises from the surface. \n\nSoon after descending into the cave, it opens into a large cavernous area filled with diamond and crystal shards. Though the creature the team was hunting seemed to be absent, signs that it had been there are plentiful. The Survey team theorizes that this cave could be the lair of one or more of the mysterious fauna of §H[Root.GetName]§!"

By examining the various creature refuse left within, science officers have been hard at work discovering their secrets. \n\nUnfortunately, it appears that the science teams were too late in their discovery of this lair, as it seems whatever may have used the cave has moved on. Still, we have theorized that the former inhabitant was indeed a singular creature and from this have determined that the species is solitary in nature. \n\nScience Officer <insert name of scientist assigned to project> further asserts that the giant crystal forests scattered across the planet have some sort of symbiotic relationship with these creatures. Further analysis of the crystal ‘plants’ is recommended."

Beginning with the cave the survey teams originally found, laser drills were set up as quickly as possible. \n\nWithin moments of breaching the surface, the incredible happened. The entire cave began to shake, stones shuddering, the cave walls vibrating with such force it knocked the drills offline and pulled the miners to the floor. Suddenly, as if something had woken from a deep sleep, the ground began rising. \n\nDespite the situation, quick thinking surveyors managed to scan the planetary surface during the cataclysm. Contact was lost with the surface team as an enormous creature, covered in crystals erupted from the ground and flew into orbit. Belatedly we suspect that the cave itself may have just been the head of this massive crystal monster."

The establishment of a full research station outside of the crystal cave has been completed and analysis of the crystals themselves well on its way. Utilizing positronic scans of the planetary surface, the research team has identified several bioforms scattered throughout the crust. \n\nAdditionally, those same scans revealed that at least part of these creatures were buried, while a small portion remained aboveground. Reasons for this were abruptly clarified when the team witnessed the ‘cave’ erupting from the surface. The cave itself was revealed to be one of the creatures! \n\nDespite their beastly nature and incredible size, the beast appeared to be at least semi-sentient. Establishing basic communications with the creature has led to our researchers gaining insights into the symbiotic relationship between the crystals and the beasts, as well as the beasts with the planet itself. \n\nAccording to our scientists, the Crystal Beasts themselves are integral to the habitability of the planet. Thanks to pleasant first contact with these Crystal Beasts, our studies into these native crystals as well as advanced symbiosis have continued to advance by leaps and bounds."

 gpm_colony.4820.desc:0 "After a long and heartfelt debate, our government has decided that on this holiday we will always put extra resources into reaching out to every other civilisation in the galaxy. Whether they are friends or foes, we shall extend a hand in friendship in hopes they will do the same. On this day, we will always consider everyone, within our civilisation and without, to be our friends and try to find mutual interests and values."
 gpm_colony.4820.a:0 "This will be a foundation of our empire as well."

 gpm_colony.4900.desc:0 "The vastness of our empire is part of what makes our civilisation strong. However, it is also becoming a weakness, for the great distances make it more difficult to maintain control over our citizens. Our government officials are concerned that without a solution to this problem, our societal integrity will become irreparably damaged."
 gpm_colony.4900.a:0 "We will research this issue."
 # Capital Event - hive mind -> gpm_synopsys_nodes stage 2
 gpm_colony.4910.name:0 "§YCapital:§! Improving Our Link"
 gpm_colony.4910.desc:0 "Our scientists believe the problem of maintaining a hive connection across our vast empire can be solved by a combination of genome editing and cybernetic implants. By changing our physical form to be compatible with very specialised implants, we could theoretically enhance the hive mind connection by a factor of a thousand or more."
 gpm_colony.4910.a:0 "This is a possible solution. Pursue it."
 # Capital Event - hive mind -> gpm_synopsys_nodes stage 3
 gpm_colony.4920.name:0 "§YCapital:§! Initial Experimentation"
 gpm_colony.4920.desc:0 "The proposed combination of genome editing and cybernetic implants has proven successful in initial laboratory experiments. Small-scale genome editing of single cells has shown promise in that these modified cells can interact with a simple electronic device. Larger scale experimentation is necessary to determine if this is possible with more complex signals."
 gpm_colony.4920.a:0 "Continue the research."
 # Capital Event - hive mind -> gpm_synopsys_nodes stage 4

 gpm_colony.4930.desc:0 "Our scientists have labored over this project, facing setback after setback and obstacle after obstacle. Although at times they feared a solution would never be found, the experiments with genome editing and cybernetic connections finally proved successful. We can now begin testing these techniques and implants, called synopsys nodes, on civilian test subjects."
 gpm_colony.4930.a:0 "Let us hope this works."

 gpm_colony.4940.desc:0 "The first few test subjects rejected the implants, but further modification of the genome corrected this problem. Our latest tests with synopsys nodes have proven quite successful. Adaptation of our citizens on our capital world has already begun, and it will continue until our hive connection is strong enough to reach every end of our galaxy. As we strengthen our link, so too do we strengthen our empire."
 gpm_colony.4940.a:0 "This is a great day for us."

 gpm_colony.5000.desc:0 "For years, our focus has been on expanding our empire. The more territory, the better. However, with so much effort spent on establishing our colonies, the infrastructure on our capital world has become obsolete. Although the colonies on the outreaches of our empire are constantly implementing the latest technological improvements, our capital remains stagnant. In some cases, the technology here is no longer compatible with the newest implemented technologies on our colonies. Our leaders are advocating for upgrades to our infrastructure. How can we call ourselves the greatest race in the galaxy when some of our civilians live in such poor conditions?"
 gpm_colony.5000.a:0 "Begin planning these upgrades."

 gpm_colony.5010.desc:0 "Upgrading the infrastructure on our capital world is an urgent project, but it requires careful planning to avoid affecting current operations. After some consideration, several algorithmic systems were developed to determine the most optimal way to begin upgrading our older infrastructure. Now that the calculations are complete, some newly designed assembly systems can be built to speed up the construction of upgrade modules."
 gpm_colony.5010.a:0 "Gather the resources to do this."

 gpm_colony.5020.desc:0 "It has taken some time to prepare, but at last the aging infrastructure on our capital world is ready to be upgraded. Careful planning has allowed us to intelligently distribute colossal amounts of resources to key points across the planet. Everything is now in place for the project to begin. It is expected that these upgrades will cause minimal interference with daily operations."
 gpm_colony.5020.a:0 "Good. Begin the upgrades."

 gpm_colony.5030.desc:0 "As requested by our leaders, our workers have submitted a report on the progress of our infrastructure modifications. We are about halfway done and are remarkably on schedule. There has been no serious interference with our normal operations. The planet is producing resources at nominal values during the upgrade process. Provided the rest of the project proceeds as planned, we expect to finish these upgrades soon."
 gpm_colony.5030.a:0 "This is good news. Continue the upgrades."

The newly installed modern systems and software are running at optimal conditions, and our resource output has never been higher. We can now turn our focus once again toward expansion and the further development of our empire's technology. Never again will we let our capital world fall into such disrepair. For our empire to be great, we must maintain every aspect of it."
