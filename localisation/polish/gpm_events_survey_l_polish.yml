 # Hollow Asteroid gpm_hollow_structure
 gpm_survey_minor.1.name:0 "Hollowed Asteroid"
 gpm_survey_minor.1.desc:0 "Our science ship has found a strange asteroid during it's survey of the system §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!. The asteroid, now named, §H[From.GetName]§! is hollow! Not only just that, it looks like it has a small hole on in it, as if something got in and hollowed it out. Or something got out that used to be inside.."
 
 # Crystallized Asteroid gpm_crystallized_structure
 gpm_survey_minor.5.name:0 "Crystallized Asteroid"
 gpm_survey_minor.5.desc:0 "Unusual crystals appear to be protruding from the asteroid named §H[From.GetName]§! in the solar system §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!. The science ship §H[root.GetName]§! has identified the crystals unusual, but natural forming. It is theorised this asteroid was part of a large moon at some point in it's life. The crystals are the result of intense heat and pressure from when this asteroid was still a deep part in this moon."
 
 # Abandoned Mining Platforms gpm_abandoned_mining_platforms
 gpm_survey_minor.10.name:0 "Derelict Platforms"
 gpm_survey_minor.10.desc:0 "Several mining platforms are attached to the large asteroid §H[From.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. Held together by chains and hooks, these platforms have several drill arms that can be remotely operated. A small bay has already been carved out of the asteroid likely to be used as a storage area for newly mined minerals until they can be picked up. It looks like whoever started mining this asteroid left in a hurry, leaving the platforms surprisingly intact."
 
 # gpm_hydrogen_mist
 gpm_survey_minor.15.name:0 "Flowing Hydrogen Mist"
 gpm_survey_minor.15.desc:0 "Thick rivers of dense hydrogen gas can be seen flowing over the surface of §H[From.GetName]§!. An unusual combination of low atmospheric pressure and static attraction from the world's surface rocks produce these elegent, slow moving, rivers of dense hydrogen gas."
 
 # gpm_salt_flats
 gpm_survey_minor.20.name:0 "Expansive Salt Flats"
 gpm_survey_minor.20.desc:0 "Endlessly stretching plains of salt crystals have been spotted on §H[From.GetName]§!! The science ship §H[root.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system speculates the world must have once been an ocean planet. A planet covered almost entirely in salt water. What happened to all this water is a mystery however. There is no natural phenomenon that can explain the disappearance of that much water. Something, or someone, must have removed all of it."
 
 # gpm_relic_lower_levels
 gpm_survey_minor.25.name:0 "Cities Build On Cities"
 gpm_survey_minor.25.desc:0 "Part of the massive endless city that is §H[From.GetName]§! has collapsed revealing that the top layer of the city planet is build on an much older city. Instead of demolishing the original city, or converting the many buildings to more modern ones, they build a giant massive platform on top of it along with new cities on that! Preposterous and insane engineering to say the least."
 
 # gpm_water_pockets
 gpm_survey_minor.30.name:0 "There's life but not as we know it!"
 gpm_survey_minor.30.desc:0 "§H[root.GetName]§! in the solar system of §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! reports trace amounts of dung have been found in an underground cavern along with small streams of liquid water. It appears some form of life exists on this otherwise dead planet. What is living here has unspiritually thus far eluded us."
 gpm_survey_minor.MEGACORPSELL_DUNG:0 "Sell the dung!"
 
 # gpm_geometrical_polar_storm
 gpm_survey_minor.35.name:0 "Edgy Storm"
 gpm_survey_minor.35.desc:0 "Our exploration of §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system is going slower than anticipated due to the discovery of a spectacular polar storm on §H[from.GetName]§!. The storm is perfectly shaped like a hexagon. A very unique pressure and wind process has shaped this near endlessly lasting storm into a perfect geometric shape."
 
 # gpm_floating_forest
 gpm_survey_minor.40.name:0 "Floating Trees"
 gpm_survey_minor.40.desc:0 "A deep scan of the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§! has revealed a strange new undiscovered phenomenon. Spread out across the gas giants upper gas layer are small pockets of floating flora. Small islands of roots and vegetation, most in tree form. The leaves and branches are huge and extremely light and sway with every gust of wind. The flowers are shaped like giant, semi-transparent elongated balloons. They giant floaty leaves simultaneously absorb the little sunlight they get and the various base chemicals found in the gas giant."
 
 # gpm_viscous_gas_layer
 gpm_survey_minor.45.name:0 "Gas or Liquid?"
 gpm_survey_minor.45.desc:0 "The atmosphere of §H[From.GetName]§! is so dense it mimics the flow of a liquid. While extremely improbable for a gas giant to have such dense gas it is not impossible. It is believed a combination of high gravity, and very fast planetary spin and extreme counter motion in the gas giants atmosphere is the reason for this unusual phenomenon."
 
 # gpm_everlasting_tornadoes
 gpm_survey_minor.50.name:0 "Eternal Tornadoes"
 gpm_survey_minor.50.desc:0 "Deep within the atmosphere of the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system rage extremely longlasting tornadoes. These massive vortexes move in the other direction the planet is spinning at roughly the same speed making them look like they never move. On top of that, the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! has so far never seen a vortex like this disappear. It seems like they last forever too."
 
 # gpm_shrinking_giant
 gpm_survey_minor.55.name:0 "Tiny Giant"
 gpm_survey_minor.55.desc:0 "§H[root.GetName]§! has discovered a unusual small gas giant. It appears the violent solar winds from the main star in §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! are the cause of this strange tiny giant. These powerful solar winds have, over the course of millions of years, stripped most of the outer and middle layer of the gas giant's gaseous atmosphere."
 
 # gpm_aeroplankton_clouds
 gpm_survey_minor.60.name:0 "Clouds of Life"
 gpm_survey_minor.60.desc:0 "Large green clouds can be seen from far away when looking at the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§!. It's vibrant green is in star contrast with the white-yellowish cloud layers and the dark brown bands of denser gas. Our science ship §H[root.GetName]§!, currently surveying the system of §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!, has discovered these green clouds are actually a life form! Tiny plankton like lifeforms float across the upper layers of the gas giant, absorbing both the gasses and sunlight in order to grow, multiply and survive."
 
 # gpm_abandoned_refineries
 gpm_survey_minor.65.name:0 "Abandoned Cloud Refineries"
 gpm_survey_minor.65.desc:0 "Deep-Echo scans from the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! have revealed various structures floating in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§!. These abandoned structures, presumably refineries, seem to be autonomously sucking in gas at the bottom and processing it into raw solid materials. After which it is storing the materials in giant hexacylinder tanks. Most of the tanks on the structures appear to be broken, burst from within, due to the pressure build up of excess of materials. We might be able to recover some of the resources in a few of the refineries."
 
 # gpm_floating_kelp
 gpm_survey_minor.70.name:0 "Floating Kelp"
 gpm_survey_minor.70.desc:0 "The gas giant §H[From.GetName]§! seems to have colossal kelp-like flora floating in it's upper atmosphere. These floating kelp are hundreds of meters long and have giant leaves all tightly winded around a central tube filled with plant sap. These tubes seem to easily transport the absorbed gasses from the leaves up to the lengthy translucent roots where sunlight converts it into nutrients."
 
 # gpm_super_heated_atmosphere
 gpm_survey_minor.75.name:0 "Scorching Gasses"
 gpm_survey_minor.75.desc:0 "The temperature of §H[From.GetName]§! is several magnitudes higher than what is expected for this type of gas giant. It appears an unusual dense core of an unknown material is producing a lot of heat. The atmosphere is so hot our probes are unable to reach the inner part of the gas giant to study what the core could be made out of. "
 
 # gpm_floatig_behemothaurs
 gpm_survey_minor.80.name:0 "Ancient Behemothaur"
 gpm_survey_minor.80.desc:0 "Occasionally surfacing in the upper atmosphere of §H[From.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! are ancient Behemothaurs. These hyper intelligent creatures are several millions years old and are home to entire ecosystems of symbiotic fauna and flora. Some of these organisms are able to interface directly with their home Behemothaur in special chambers, in order to share information with their host. Certain animals are sometimes given the role of Interpreter, serving as liaisons between visiting sentient life and the Behemothaur itself."
 
 # gpm_magma_ocean
 gpm_survey_minor.85.name:0 "Magma Ocean"
 gpm_survey_minor.85.desc:0 "The planet §H[From.GetName]§! deep within the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! solar system seems to have a giant ocean of magma. An endless stretch of liquid molten rock. Deep resonance scans indicate part of the core is fully exposed in this area which explains how the magma can stay so hot and liquid."
 
 # gpm_heavy_elements
 gpm_survey_minor.90.name:0 "Vital Elements"
 gpm_survey_minor.90.desc:0 "A strange phenomenon deep in the core of §H[From.GetName]§! has resulted in a lot of minerals and chemicals fusing and reacting together to form very rare heavy elements. The constant tectonic activity has pushed most of those to the surface. With proper equipment this could provide a good addition to our mining efforts."
 
 # gpm_rare_metals
 gpm_survey_minor.95.name:0 "Precious Metals"
 gpm_survey_minor.95.desc:0 "The solar system §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! is home to a very tame and stable star. This was not the case billions of years ago, when another star had it's home here. With the death of this other star a lot of rare and precious metals were formed. These metals then started coalesce into small chunks, which then turned into bigger asteroids, until they eventually became a proto-planet. This planet is now called §H[From.GetName]§! and has a substantial amount of precious resources"
 
 # gpm_proto_planet
 gpm_survey_minor.100.name:0 "Proto Planet"
 gpm_survey_minor.100.desc:0 "According to §H[root.leader.GetName]§! on the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! the planet of §H[From.GetName]§! is a proto-planet. A very young planet, barely a million years old. Much much younger than the other planets in this system. The exact nature of how this planet came to be so late is unknown and worthy of investigation."
 
 # gpm_flat_terrain
#  gpm_survey_minor.105.name:0 "Flatter Than Flat"
#  gpm_survey_minor.105.desc:0 "captain we found cool space shit"
 # gpm_old_world
 gpm_survey_minor.110.name:0 "The Old World"
 gpm_survey_minor.110.desc:0 "Home to buried, decrepit buildings, §H[From.GetName]§! use to be inhabited by a forgotten civilisation. It is unclear how far this civilisation advanced, though it is believed it has never gotten beyond the age of swords and spears. Large broken down stone buildings, half buried palaces and crumbling walls were found, but no sign of steel or any advanced building material. How the life of such a young civilisation was snuffed out is unclear."
 
 # gpm_solidified_core
 gpm_survey_minor.115.name:0 "Dead Planet"
 gpm_survey_minor.115.desc:0 "When the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! tried to do a standard tectonic scan on the planet §H[From.GetName]§! as part of it's survey routine, it got no results. Most specifically, it got one result: this planet is dead. The core of this world has completely cooled and solidified into a single ball of dense iron and magnesium. It's theorised that, even with the most advanced of technologies, it would be impossible to make this world liveable by terraforming it."
 
 # gpm_subterranean_eco_system
 gpm_survey_minor.120.name:0 "Life, Uh.. Finds A Way"
 gpm_survey_minor.120.desc:0 "A large, mostly sealed, cavern system has been found on §H[From.GetName]§!. A small drone of ours had penetrated the surface of this world to do a mineral and soil study and stumbled upon this cave system by accident. To all our surprise, it is filled with life! A sprawling self-sustaining eco-system has managed to survive here. This world must have supported a much wider variety of life at some point in it's life cycle."
 
 # gpm_plasma_tornadoes
 gpm_survey_minor.125.name:0 "Plasma Whirls"
 gpm_survey_minor.125.desc:0 "The unusual active corona from the star §H[From.GetName]§! helps create large vortices whenever the star of the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! solar system ejects material through it's solar flares. Large local disruptions in the magnetosphere are causing particles and plasma to then return to the star in swirling patters, creating massive slow rotating plasma vortices."
 
 # gpm_singing_star
 gpm_survey_minor.130.name:0 "Star Of The Opera"
 gpm_survey_minor.130.desc:0 "While scanning the star §H[From.GetName]§! our science ship's onboard computers quickly detected repeating patterns in the radio-frequency signals it emanates. An engineer recognised some of these patterns from a piece of music it once observed.

Several high-pitched roars echoed across the hive as the biological layer covering the incubation chamber ruptured and a thick, purple, ooze started leaking. Shortly afterwards the top of the hive started opening and several small creatures emerged from the chamber and flew straight towards the science team.

The building is still powered and contains only a few rooms. Strange markings not too dissimilar from runes skitter across the display surfaces. It is possible that this could be the remnants of an archaic language. Or the ramblings of a long-dead madman.\n\nOur Syntax VI asserts that continued research of this runic language could lead to significant advances in understanding of alien social constructs and idioms. Even if those aliens vanished eons ago. "
