 gpm_d_discharging_field_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nStrange stone structures cover large portions of this land, erratically releasing hazardous charges of electricity. Whatever generates such discharges is beyond our theoretical knowledge, as well as the conductive materials these stones could be made of. Also, the constantly changing magnetic fields seem to excite most electronic devices."

 gpm_d_crystal_jungle_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nHigh quality minerals can be found in these dense forests, protruding from the vegetation as if it was a mere waste. Initial research endorses that the crystals act as means of attracting creatures that help the vegetation spread, and different crystals appear to attract different species. Expert engineers have predicted many applications for the biological mechanisms of mineral extraction and crystal generation. Layers and layers of mineral deposits can be found in the surroundings, left by generations of these curious plants."

 gpm_d_floating_islands:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §EFloating Continent§!"
 gpm_d_floating_islands_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nSmall static continents float in thin air, suspended by yet unknown forces.

 gpm_d_howling_peaks_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nHollow, bored mountains that reverberate and howl as the constant strong winds goes by. Low pitch sounds can be heard from miles away, and if one goes closer, the high pitch sounds can be deafening. These reverberations also generate electromagnetic and gravitational waves, what is even more intriguing. How this phenomenon can create space-time distortions remains to be studied. Furthermore the strange shapes and craveses in these mountains provide easier access to the mountain's rich mineral veins."

 gpm_d_mega_fungi:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §EMega Fungi§!"
 gpm_d_mega_fungi_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nSpreading over vast regions of the planet is a colossal organism, growing multiple spore-bearing projections, with these branches being capable of limited and slow movement. Strange behaviors were observed in expeditions, as it seems to retract it's branches in a matter of hours if any part of it is violated, and actively seeking the food left by our scientists, though very slowly. Traces of net neural activity are scarce but currently not discarded. During expeditions, the Mega-Fungi has also proved to be an excellent source of re-growing, edible food."

 gpm_d_energy_storm:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §EEnergy Storm§!"
 gpm_d_energy_storm_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nChaotic energy storms punish large regions of this idyllic world, spinning and roaring in a vicious cycle of bursts. Their position is well known, and for the planet's sake it doesn't appear to migrate around the globe like regular storms, there is strong evidence that these anomalies have been stationary for uncountable ages. Mildly radioactive, all kinds of energy patterns seem to come out of it, defying even the most audacious scientific models. One of the greatest phenomena our scientists ever encountered, the academy is stunned and impatiently asking for closer investigation. According to preliminary study, the strange energy waves seem to power most the our electronics."

 gpm_d_titanic_cave:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §ETitanic Caves§!"
 gpm_d_titanic_cave_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nThese marvelous caves provide an excellent path for exploration of inner planet activity and rare mineral structures only found in these depths, greatly increasing our understanding of rocky celestial bodies. The sheer size of these caves means we can fit entire cities in them and greatly increase the pottential for expansion on this world."

 gpm_d_abandoned_stargate:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §EAbandoned Stargate§!"
 gpm_d_abandoned_stargate_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nA mysterious structure built with unknown technology.

Controlled mining of these sturdy stones could provide a renewable source of minerals."

 gpm_d_lava_lake:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §ELava Lake§!"
 gpm_d_lava_lake_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nUnusually large volumes of molten lava emerge and gurgle toxic fumes across large regions of the planet, forming these lava lakes. Geothermal activity in the surroundings is intense, making these areas proper for gas generation facilities."

 gpm_d_Collapsed_habitat:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §ECollapsed Habitat§!"
 gpm_d_Collapsed_habitat_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nLarge wreckages cover extensive regions of the planet. Formerly a xeno habitat, it's origins are unknown and it's technology, unlike any feasible habitat project. Regions surrounding the most significant debris locations have a significant spread of a strange liquid metal."

 gpm_d_dangerous_hives:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §EDangerous Hives§!"
 gpm_d_dangerous_hives_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nSwarms of vicious creatures are housed inside these rudimentary structures. These colonies managed to cover most regions of the globe with vast hive networks. Orbital bombardment is highly advised before landing troops."

 gpm_d_forgotten_deposit:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §EForgotten Deposit§!"
 gpm_d_forgotten_deposit_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nInitially described as nuclear shelters, these enormous facilities are indeed long forgotten deposits. No traces of the previous owners were found, though most of these automated facilities remains operational. It contains considerable amounts of ultra-heavy chemical elements, preserved in large tanks of a strange technology, almost as if frozen in time. Sadly, a few damaged sections seem to have been leaking highly radioactive content for hundreds of years. The preserved elements bear uncalculable rarity, and synthesization is extremely difficult. Also, present containment technology could barely slow the decay outside the tanks."

 gpm_d_ruined_arcology:0 "£gpm_planet_wonder  §ERuined Arcology§!"
 gpm_d_ruined_arcology_desc:0 "§HPlanetary Wonders§!£gpm_planet_wonder  are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nAn once thriving acropolis, these colossal ruins represent the pinnacle of sustainable architecture.
